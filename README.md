Hi there! My name is Ivoine and I am a teenager who is passionate about computer science and technology. I have been interested in coding since I was a young child, and I have been teaching myself through online courses and personal projects.

I am excited to join the GitHub community and share my journey with others. As a teenager, I am still learning and growing, and I am motivated by the idea of sharing my experiences and receiving feedback from others. I hope to learn from other developers, build my skills, and create interesting and useful projects.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. I look forward to learning and growing together!
