Hi there! My name is Ivoine and I am a high school dropout who is passionate about Coding. I have always been interested in Coding, and I have been teaching myself through online courses and personal projects.

Although I did not graduate from high school, I have not let that stop me from pursuing my dreams. I am a self-starter and a lifelong learner, and I am constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and grow.

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. I look forward to learning and growing together!
